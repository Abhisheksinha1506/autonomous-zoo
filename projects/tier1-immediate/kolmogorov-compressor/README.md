# Kolmogorov Compressor — The Master Squeezer



## 📖 The Analogy

> This project is like a traveler trying to pack a massive suitcase into a tiny backpack without losing anything. It keeps trying different ways to fold its own code until it finds the smallest possible way to stay exactly the same.

> **Aggressively searches for the shortest possible description of its own code**

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept

**Algorithmic Complexity**

[TODO: Add detailed mathematical explanation]

## 🎯 What This Does

Every day, the repository:
1. [TODO: Describe evolution steps]
2. [TODO: Describe state changes]
3. Logs progress to `history.md` every 6 hours (staggered schedule)

## 📊 Current State

- **Generation**: Check `state.json`
- **Status**: See `history.md`

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step
```

## 📖 Layman Explanation

"A writer trying to tell a story using the fewest words possible without losing the plot."

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Custom mathematical evolution logic
- **Parameters**: [TODO: List parameters]
- **Safety Bounds**: [TODO: Describe limits]

## 📈 Evolution Log

See [history.md](history.md) for the complete evolution timeline.


## 🛠️ Technical Anatomy

- **DNA**: [evolve.py](evolve.py) (The instructions for life)
- **Vital Signs**: [state.json](state.json) (Current memory and state)
- **Evolutionary Diary**: [history.md](history.md) (Historical logs)
