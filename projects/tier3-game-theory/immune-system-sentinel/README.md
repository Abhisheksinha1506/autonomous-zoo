# Immune System Sentinel — The Repository's White Blood Cells



## 📖 The Analogy

> This project acts like a living body's defense system. It creates a profile of what 'healthy' files look like and constantly patrols the repo to identify and eliminate any 'foreign germs' or corrupted data.

> **Detects anomalous files and eliminates them; maintains self definition**

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept

**Clonal Selection**

Artificial Immune Systems (AIS). Computational models inspired by the biological immune system's ability to distinguish 'self' from 'non-self' and defend against pathogens.

## 🎯 What This Does

Every day, the repository:
1. 1. Learns the 'DNA' (hash signatures) of all early project files
2. Generates 'Antibodies' that represent normal system behavior
3. Performs 'Negative Selection' to find any files that don't match the signature
4. Reports or 'Eliminates' foreign files to preserve the repo's integrity.
2. Every generation, the project updates its `state.json` file with the latest calculation, preserving the chain of life across GitHub Action cycles.
3. Logs progress to `history.md` every 6 hours (staggered schedule)

## 📊 Current State

- **Generation**: Check `state.json`
- **Status**: See `history.md`

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step
```

## 📖 Layman Explanation

"Body fighting viruses — the repo scans for 'weird' files daily, 'vaccinating' against them."

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Custom mathematical evolution logic
- **Parameters**: [TODO: List parameters]
- **Safety Bounds**: [TODO: Describe limits]

## 📈 Evolution Log

See [history.md](history.md) for the complete evolution timeline.


## 🛠️ Technical Anatomy
