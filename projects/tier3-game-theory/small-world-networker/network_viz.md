# Network Topology History

## Generation 1
> **What happened?** The repository's internal network topology was rewired today. A new shortcut was created between distant nodes, making the entire project structure 'smaller' and more efficiently connected. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- **Action**: Rewired edge 7-8 to 7-14
- **Total Edges**: 20

## Generation 2
> **What happened?** The repository's internal network topology was rewired today. The current network structure is already highly efficient, so no new shortcuts were needed today. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- **Action**: No structural changes
- **Total Edges**: 20

## Generation 3
> **What happened?** The repository's internal network topology was rewired today. The current network structure is already highly efficient, so no new shortcuts were needed today. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- **Action**: No structural changes
- **Total Edges**: 20

## Generation 4
> **What happened?** The repository's internal network topology was rewired today. A new shortcut was created between distant nodes, making the entire project structure 'smaller' and more efficiently connected. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- **Action**: Rewired edge 19-0 to 19-4
- **Total Edges**: 20

## Generation 5
> **What happened?** The repository's internal network topology was rewired today. The current network structure is already highly efficient, so no new shortcuts were needed today. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- **Action**: No structural changes

## Generation 6
> **What happened?** The repository's internal network topology was rewired today. A new shortcut was created between distant nodes, making the entire project structure 'smaller' and more efficiently connected. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- **Total Edges**: 20

## Generation 10
> **What happened?** The repository's internal network topology was rewired today. The current network structure is already highly efficient, so no new shortcuts were needed today. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- **Action**: Rewired edge 8-9 to 8-3
- **Total Edges**: 20

## Generation 12
