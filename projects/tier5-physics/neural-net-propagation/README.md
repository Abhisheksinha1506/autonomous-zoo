# Neural Net Propagation — The Spark of Thought



## 📖 The Analogy

> This project acts like a tiny artificial brain. One small signal triggers a cascade of 'firing' neurons, creating a unique pattern of thought that ripples through the entire repository.

> **Files activate neighbors; cascading firing patterns emerge**

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept

**Graph Computation**

Neural Activation Models. Simulates how biological neurons fire and pass signals to neighbors via synaptic connections, creating complex patterns of electrical activity.

## 🎯 What This Does

Every day, the repository:
1. 1. Stimulates a random 'Node' in a network of 15 virtual neurons
2. Propagates the signal across 'Weights' to connected neighbors
3. Applies an activation function to decide if the next neuron should 'Fire'
4. Logs the cascading firing patterns to the repository's history.
2. Every generation, the project updates its `state.json` file with the latest calculation, preserving the chain of life across GitHub Action cycles.
3. Logs progress to `history.md` every 6 hours (staggered schedule)

## 📊 Current State

- **Generation**: Check `state.json`
- **Status**: See `history.md`

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step
```

## 📖 Layman Explanation

"Brain signals firing — files 'light up' daily in chains, like thoughts spreading through a network."

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Custom mathematical evolution logic
- **Parameters**: Firing threshold, Decay rate, Synaptic weights
- **Safety Bounds**: Cascading signal limits, node activation frequency caps

## 📈 Evolution Log

See [history.md](history.md) for the complete evolution timeline.
