# Thermodynamic Equilibrium — The Cooling Embers



### 📢 Latest Status
<!-- LATEST_STATUS_START -->
*Awaiting first evolution...*
<!-- LATEST_STATUS_END -->


## 📖 The Analogy

> Like a fireplace after the logs have burnt down, this project slowly redistributes energy until everything is perfectly even. It is a simulation of a system finding peace and total balance.

> **Evolves toward heat death where all file interactions are uniform**

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept

**Entropy / 2nd Law**

Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. States that in an isolated system, disorder (Entropy) always increases until it reaches a state of maximum balance.

## 🎯 What This Does

Every day, the repository:
1. 1. Assigns random 'Energy Levels' to 20 internal cells
2. Simulates energy exchange between neighboring cells
3. Measures 'System Variance' as a proxy for order/disorder
4. Watches as the system cools down and stabilizes at its 'Entropy Peak'.
2. Every generation, the project updates its `state.json` file with the latest calculation, preserving the chain of life across GitHub Action cycles.
3. Logs progress to `history.md` every 6 hours (staggered schedule)

## 📊 Current State

- **Generation**: Check `state.json`
- **Status**: See `history.md`

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step
```

## 📖 Layman Explanation

"Hot coffee cooling — files 'calm down' daily, reaching balance like the universe winding down."

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Custom mathematical evolution logic
- **Parameters**: Energy transfer rate, Particle count
- **Safety Bounds**: Total energy conservation, temperature floor at 0

## 📈 Evolution Log

See [history.md](history.md) for the complete evolution timeline.
