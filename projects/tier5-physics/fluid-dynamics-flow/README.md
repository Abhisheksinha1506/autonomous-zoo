# Fluid Dynamics Flow — The Digital River



## 📖 The Analogy

> Think of this repo as a stream of water. It simulates how ripples spread and how tiny whirlpools form, moving digital weight across the folders as if they were floating on a river.

> **Simulates laminar/turbulent flow as file creation/deletion waves**

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept

**Navier-Stokes**

[TODO: Add detailed mathematical explanation]

## 🎯 What This Does

Every day, the repository:
1. [TODO: Describe evolution steps]
2. [TODO: Describe state changes]
3. Logs progress to `history.md` every 6 hours (staggered schedule)

## 📊 Current State

- **Generation**: Check `state.json`
- **Status**: See `history.md`

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step
```

## 📖 Layman Explanation

"Water swirling in a pipe — files 'flow' daily, creating smooth or chaotic waves, like simulating rivers."

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Custom mathematical evolution logic
- **Parameters**: [TODO: List parameters]
- **Safety Bounds**: [TODO: Describe limits]

## 📈 Evolution Log

See [history.md](history.md) for the complete evolution timeline.


## 🛠️ Technical Anatomy

- **DNA**: [evolve.py](evolve.py) (The instructions for life)
- **Vital Signs**: [state.json](state.json) (Current memory and state)
- **Evolutionary Diary**: [history.md](history.md) (Historical logs)
