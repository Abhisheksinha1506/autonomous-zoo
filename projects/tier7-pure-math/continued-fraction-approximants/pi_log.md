# Pi Approximation History

## Generation 1
> **What happened?** The project's mathematical 'lens' sharpened today. By using continued fractions to calculate an approximation of Pi (22/7), it reduced its calculation error to 1.264489267350e-03, approaching infinite precision. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- PI ≈ 22/7 | Error: 1.264489267350e-03
## Generation 2
> **What happened?** The project's mathematical 'lens' sharpened today. By using continued fractions to calculate an approximation of Pi (333/106), it reduced its calculation error to 8.321962752911e-05, approaching infinite precision. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*
