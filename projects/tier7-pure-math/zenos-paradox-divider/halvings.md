# Infinite Division History

## Generation 1
> **What happened?** The repository's target distance was halved today. Following Zeno's famous paradox, the project is approaching its destination but will never quite reach it, as it infinitely divide the remaining space into smaller and smaller increments. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*
