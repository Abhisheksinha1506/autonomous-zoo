# Integer Partition History

## Generation 1
> **What happened?** The repository explored the theory of additive partitions today, counting the ways to build the number 2. The resulting count p(2) = 2 adds another data point to the sequence, showing how quickly complexity grows from simple building blocks. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Count: p(2) = 2
## Generation 2
> **What happened?** The repository explored the theory of additive partitions today, counting the ways to build the number 3. The resulting count p(3) = 3 adds another data point to the sequence, showing how quickly complexity grows from simple building blocks. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Count: p(3) = 3
## Generation 3
> **What happened?** The repository explored the theory of additive partitions today, counting the ways to build the number 4. The resulting count p(4) = 5 adds another data point to the sequence, showing how quickly complexity grows from simple building blocks. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Count: p(4) = 5
## Generation 4
> **What happened?** The repository explored the theory of additive partitions today, counting the ways to build the number 5. The resulting count p(5) = 7 adds another data point to the sequence, showing how quickly complexity grows from simple building blocks. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Count: p(5) = 7
## Generation 5
> **What happened?** The repository explored the theory of additive partitions today, counting the ways to build the number 6. The resulting count p(6) = 11 adds another data point to the sequence, showing how quickly complexity grows from simple building blocks. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Count: p(6) = 11
## Generation 6
> **What happened?** The repository explored the theory of additive partitions today, counting the ways to build the number 7. The resulting count p(7) = 15 adds another data point to the sequence, showing how quickly complexity grows from simple building blocks. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Count: p(7) = 15
## Generation 7
> **What happened?** The repository explored the theory of additive partitions today, counting the ways to build the number 8. The resulting count p(8) = 22 adds another data point to the sequence, showing how quickly complexity grows from simple building blocks. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Count: p(8) = 22
## Generation 8
> **What happened?** The repository explored the theory of additive partitions today, counting the ways to build the number 9. The resulting count p(9) = 30 adds another data point to the sequence, showing how quickly complexity grows from simple building blocks. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Count: p(9) = 30
## Generation 9
> **What happened?** The repository explored the theory of additive partitions today, counting the ways to build the number 10. The resulting count p(10) = 42 adds another data point to the sequence, showing how quickly complexity grows from simple building blocks. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Count: p(10) = 42
## Generation 10
> **What happened?** The repository explored the theory of additive partitions today, counting the ways to build the number 11. The resulting count p(11) = 56 adds another data point to the sequence, showing how quickly complexity grows from simple building blocks. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Count: p(11) = 56
## Generation 11
> **What happened?** The repository explored the theory of additive partitions today, counting the ways to build the number 12. The resulting count p(12) = 77 adds another data point to the sequence, showing how quickly complexity grows from simple building blocks. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Count: p(12) = 77
