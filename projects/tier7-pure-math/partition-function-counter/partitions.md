# Integer Partition History

## Generation 1
> **What happened?** The repository explored the theory of additive partitions today, counting the ways to build the number 2. The resulting count p(2) = 2 adds another data point to the sequence, showing how quickly complexity grows from simple building blocks. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Count: p(2) = 2
## Generation 2
> **What happened?** The repository explored the theory of additive partitions today, counting the ways to build the number 3. The resulting count p(3) = 3 adds another data point to the sequence, showing how quickly complexity grows from simple building blocks. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Count: p(3) = 3
## Generation 3
> **What happened?** The repository explored the theory of additive partitions today, counting the ways to build the number 4. The resulting count p(4) = 5 adds another data point to the sequence, showing how quickly complexity grows from simple building blocks. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Count: p(4) = 5
## Generation 4
> **What happened?** The repository explored the theory of additive partitions today, counting the ways to build the number 5. The resulting count p(5) = 7 adds another data point to the sequence, showing how quickly complexity grows from simple building blocks. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Count: p(5) = 7
