# Topological Distance Metrics

## Generation 1
> **What happened?** Two digital points drifted through the repo's topological space today. The project compared how far they moved using two different 'yardsticks': the blocky Taxicab metric (9 units) and the straight-line Euclidean metric (6.4031 units). *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

## Generation 2
> **What happened?** Two digital points drifted through the repo's topological space today. The project compared how far they moved using two different 'yardsticks': the blocky Taxicab metric (10 units) and the straight-line Euclidean metric (7.0711 units). *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*
