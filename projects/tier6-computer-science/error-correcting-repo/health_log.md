# System Integrity History

## Generation 1
> **What happened?** The repository's 'digital immune system' checked for bit-level errors today. The repo's data integrity is perfect; no errors or 'bit-flips' were detected during the latest sweep. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Status Action: No errors detected -> Self-healed from redundancy.
## Generation 2
> **What happened?** The repository's 'digital immune system' checked for bit-level errors today.
