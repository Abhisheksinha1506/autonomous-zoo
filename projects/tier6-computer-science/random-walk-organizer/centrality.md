# Centrality Hub Evolution

## Generation 1
> **What happened?** A digital wanderer took several random steps through the repo's network today. By tracking which nodes were visited most often, the system identified a new 'hub' and strengthened the connection from itself to improve overall navigation. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Hub Action: Static topology | Visits: {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'C': 3, 'D': 1, 'E': 0}
## Generation 2
