# Fractal Music Box — The Echoing Melody



### 📢 Latest Status
<!-- LATEST_STATUS_START -->
*Awaiting first evolution...*
<!-- LATEST_STATUS_END -->


## 📖 The Analogy

> A music box that plays a melody that is built into itself. Whether you listen to the whole song or zoom in on one tiny second, the rhythm remains exactly the same, repeating forever like an echo.

> **Generates self-similar musical compositions based on Cantor dust**

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept

**Cantor Set Melody**

The Cantor Set. A fractal generated by repeatedly removing the middle third of a line segment, creating a self-similar rhythm that looks the same at any scale.

## 🎯 What This Does

Every day, the repository:
1. 1. Generates a rhythm using the Cantor subdivision rule
2. Interprets 'Bricks' (filled thirds) as beats and 'Spaces' as silence
3. Increases complexity by diving into deeper 'Levels' of the fractal
4. Plays back the rhythm in a visual ASCII music score.
2. Every generation, the project updates its `state.json` file with the latest calculation, preserving the chain of life across GitHub Action cycles.
3. Logs progress to `history.md` every 6 hours (staggered schedule)

## 📊 Current State

- **Generation**: Check `state.json`
- **Status**: See `history.md`

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step
```

## 📖 Layman Explanation

"Infinite echoes in music — breaks notes into smaller repeats daily, creating fractal songs."

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Custom mathematical evolution logic
- **Parameters**: Cantor depth, Beat subdivision factor
- **Safety Bounds**: Maximum rhythm density, timing interval anchoring

## 📈 Evolution Log

See [history.md](history.md) for the complete evolution timeline.
