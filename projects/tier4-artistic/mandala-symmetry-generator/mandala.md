# Dihedral Symmetry Log

## Generation 1
> **What happened?** The repository's internal geometry was reflected and rotated today. Using D8 symmetry, the generator arranged digital points into a perfect mandala, ensuring that every change on one side is echoed perfectly across the entire structure. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- Points Generated: 16
- Symmetry Group: D8
