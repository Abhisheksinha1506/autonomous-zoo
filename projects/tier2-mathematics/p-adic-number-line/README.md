# P-adic Number Line — The Branching Tree of Numbers



### 📢 Latest Status
<!-- LATEST_STATUS_START -->
*Awaiting first evolution...*
<!-- LATEST_STATUS_END -->


## 📖 The Analogy

> Instead of a straight line, this project sees numbers as a vast, branching tree. It organizes its files by following these branches, where the further you go out, the 'smaller' the distance back to the center becomes.

> **Organizes files into an ultrametric tree where triangles are always isosceles**

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept

**Metric Geometry**

p-adic Analysis. An alternative to the standard real number system where 'closeness' is determined by divisibility by a prime number p. Useful in number theory and cryptography.

## 🎯 What This Does

Every day, the repository:
1. 1. Sets a base prime 'p' for the coordinate system
2. Places files at positions along a p-adic tree
3. Calculates distances between files using the p-adic norm
4. Drifts the files such that 'far' objects in standard math become 'close' in p-adic space.
2. Every generation, the project updates its `state.json` file with the latest calculation, preserving the chain of life across GitHub Action cycles.
3. Logs progress to `history.md` every 6 hours (staggered schedule)

## 📊 Current State

- **Generation**: Check `state.json`
- **Status**: See `history.md`

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step
```

## 📖 Layman Explanation

"A family tree where you are always 'close' to your ancestors, no matter how many generations back you go."

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Custom mathematical evolution logic
- **Parameters**: Prime p, Valuation norm factor
- **Safety Bounds**: Strict p-adic metric bounds, tree depth limits

## 📈 Evolution Log

See [history.md](history.md) for the complete evolution timeline.
