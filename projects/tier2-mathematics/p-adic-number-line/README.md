# P-adic Number Line — The Branching Tree of Numbers



## 📖 The Analogy

> Instead of a straight line, this project sees numbers as a vast, branching tree. It organizes its files by following these branches, where the further you go out, the 'smaller' the distance back to the center becomes.

> **Organizes files into an ultrametric tree where triangles are always isosceles**

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept

**Metric Geometry**

[TODO: Add detailed mathematical explanation]

## 🎯 What This Does

Every day, the repository:
1. [TODO: Describe evolution steps]
2. [TODO: Describe state changes]
3. Logs progress to `history.md` every 6 hours (staggered schedule)

## 📊 Current State

- **Generation**: Check `state.json`
- **Status**: See `history.md`

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step
```

## 📖 Layman Explanation

"A family tree where you are always 'close' to your ancestors, no matter how many generations back you go."

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Custom mathematical evolution logic
- **Parameters**: [TODO: List parameters]
- **Safety Bounds**: [TODO: Describe limits]

## 📈 Evolution Log

See [history.md](history.md) for the complete evolution timeline.


## 🛠️ Technical Anatomy

- **DNA**: [evolve.py](evolve.py) (The instructions for life)
- **Vital Signs**: [state.json](state.json) (Current memory and state)
- **Evolutionary Diary**: [history.md](history.md) (Historical logs)
