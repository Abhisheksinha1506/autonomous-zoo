# Gödel Number Encoder — The Universal Translator



### 📢 Latest Status

*Awaiting first evolution...*

## 📖 The Analogy

> This project takes the entire soul of the repository and translates it into a single, incredibly long number. It's like turning a whole library into a secret code that only primes can understand.

> **Encodes its own file structure into a single massive integer (Gödel numbering)**

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept

**Logic / Self-Reference**

Gödel Numbering. A mapping that assigns to each symbol and formula of a formal language a unique natural number, allowing mathematical logic to analyze itself.

## 🎯 What This Does

Every day, the repository:
1. 1. Takes the current text of the repository README
2. Breaks the text into symbols and maps them to a sequence of prime numbers
3. Multiplies these primes together (raised to the power of the symbol code)
4. Stores the resulting massive 'Gödel Number' as the repo's unique identity.
2. Every generation, the project updates its `state.json` file with the latest calculation, preserving the chain of life across GitHub Action cycles.
3. Logs progress to `history.md` every 6 hours (staggered schedule)

## 📊 Current State

- **Generation**: Check `state.json`
- **Status**: See `history.md`

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step
```

## 📖 Layman Explanation

"Turning an entire book into a single barcode number that can be scanned to get the book back."

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Custom mathematical evolution logic
- **Parameters**: Prime Base (2, 3, 5...), Charset encoding map
- **Safety Bounds**: Integer overflow protection (using Python large ints), file size limits

## 📈 Evolution Log

See [history.md](history.md) for the complete evolution timeline.
