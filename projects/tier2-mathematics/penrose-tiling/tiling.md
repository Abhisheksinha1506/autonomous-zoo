# Penrose Tiling Evolution


## Generation 1 — 2026-01-27

> **What happened?** The non-repeating pattern of tiles grew today. Its structure follows strict aperiodic rules, creating a infinite floor that never repeats its blueprint, much like a crystal that can't exist in 3D space. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

Pattern consists of 5 basic tiles.
Status: Aperiodic order maintained. No translational symmetry detected.
