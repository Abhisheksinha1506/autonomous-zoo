# Penrose Tiling — The Infinite Floor Designer



## 📖 The Analogy

> This project is laying tiles on an infinite floor. The catch? The pattern never repeats itself, even if you walk forever, creating a beautiful mosaic that is always unique.

> **Builds a non-repeating, perfectly structured infinite floor**

## 🧠 Mathematical Concept

**Aperiodic Tiling**

Aperiodic Tilings. A non-periodic tiling generated by an aperiodic set of prototiles, creating infinite patterns that never repeat themselves perfectly.

## 🎯 What This Does

Every day, the repository:
1. 1. Starts with a set of 'Kite' and 'Dart' prototiles
2. Applies 'Subdivision' rules to split tiles into smaller segments
3. Checks 'Matching Rules' to ensure the pattern remains aperiodic
4. Generates a new layer of the infinite mosaic in each generation.
2. Every generation, the project updates its `state.json` file with the latest calculation, preserving the chain of life across GitHub Action cycles.
3. Logs progress to `history.md` every 6 hours (staggered schedule)

## 📊 Current State

- **Generation**: Check `state.json`
- **Status**: See `history.md`

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
python evolve.py  # Run one evolution step
```

## 📖 Layman Explanation

"Tiling a floor with two shapes that fit so perfectly they never repeat, no matter how big the floor gets."

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Custom mathematical evolution logic
- **Parameters**: Order (Subdivision depth), Phi (Golden Ratio)
- **Safety Bounds**: Memory limit on tile count, recursion depth anchoring

## 📈 Evolution Log

See [history.md](history.md) for the complete evolution timeline.
