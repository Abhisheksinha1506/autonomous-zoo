# Knot Invariants Log

## Generation 1
> **What happened?** The mathematical knot in this repository executed a Reidemeister III Move today. Its structural invariant (the Jones Polynomial) has shifted, reflecting a new topology that is fundamentally different from yesterday's state. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- **Action**: Reidemeister III Move
- **Jones Polynomial**: V(t) = t + t^3 - t^4

## Generation 2
> **What happened?** The mathematical knot in this repository executed a Crossing Flip today. Its structural invariant (the Jones Polynomial) has shifted, reflecting a new topology that is fundamentally different from yesterday's state. *The atmosphere feels calm today with a social pressure of 0.00.*

- **Action**: Crossing Flip
- **Jones Polynomial**: V(t) = t^2 + t^2^3 - t^2^4
