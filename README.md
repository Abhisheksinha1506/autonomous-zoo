# 🧬 The Autonomous Zoo

> **A Living Collection of Self-Evolving Mathematical Organisms**

Welcome to the **Autonomous Zoo** — a curated collection of 32 unique GitHub repositories that evolve autonomously through mathematical principles. Each "organism" runs daily without human intervention, exploring chaos theory, number theory, game theory, physics simulations, and pure mathematics.

---

## 🌟 Philosophy

These repositories are not static code. They are **digital life forms** that:
- **Self-modify** their own structure based on mathematical rules
- **Commit changes** automatically via GitHub Actions
- **Explore** mathematical landscapes (attractors, primes, fractals, equilibria)
- **Emerge** complex behavior from simple rules

Each project is a **proof of concept** that code can be beautiful, autonomous, and educational.
