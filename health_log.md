> **What happened?** The repository's 'digital immune system' checked for bit-level errors today. It discovered a small corruption in a file and immediately used its internal redundancy to self-heal, restoring the original state without any loss of logic.

- Status Action: CRITICAL: Corruption detected at index 1 -> Self-healed from redundancy.
